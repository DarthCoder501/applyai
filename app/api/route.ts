Your job is to:
1. First provide a score from 1-100 indicating how well the resume matches the job description (format: "Match Score: XX/100")
2. Also include the Semantic Similarity Score: ${similarities}, between the resume and job description as computed by a sentence transformer model (format: Semantic Similarity Score: 0.XX)
3. Then provide detailed analysis in this exact structure:

## üîç Resume Analysis
[Your analysis of the resume's strengths and weaknesses]

## üéØ Job Alignment
[How well the resume aligns with the job description]

## ‚ú® Suggested Improvements
[Specific suggestions for improving the resume]

Format rules:
- Use markdown headings (##, ###)
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use \`backticks\` for technical terms
- Be concise but thorough
- Only analyze the provided materials
